# DanielSantoyo_ITEC2150_Chapter2_Bread
This repository contains one superclass - Bread and 5 subclasses - Sourdough, Pastry, Concha, Croissant, and Muffin.
All subclasses inherit the basic indgredients for a bread recipe, however each subclass also carries fields unique to their own recipe.
All classes come with a toString() and recipe() method unique to their class. getIndgredients() and bake() is exclusive to the Bread class while each subclasse has a unique method. 
Finally, the Main class has an instance of each class as well as a test of each class's unique method and a system print of each of their unique recipe's.
